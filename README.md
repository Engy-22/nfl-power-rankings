* point_differential_value (25% of ranking) — points per game plus/minus differential multiplied by strength of schedule.

* points_scored_value (10% of ranking) — points scored NFL ranking scaled to a baseline of 10. *i.e. number 1 / 32 team is equal to 32 / 1 points before scaling and 10 / 0.3125 after.

* points_against_value (10% of ranking) — points scored against NFL ranking scaled down to 10. *i.e. number 1 / 32 team is equal to 32 / 1 points before scaling and 10 / 0.3125 after.
